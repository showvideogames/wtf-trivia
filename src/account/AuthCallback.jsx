/**
 * /auth/callback — the ONLY page that turns a sign-in code into a session.
 *
 * The shared sign-in page sends the browser back here with a one-time code.
 * The code is exchanged for a local WTF session, the account row is created
 * or refreshed (ensure_account), and the player is returned to the page they
 * left from. Every failure lands on a sentence and a way back, never a blank
 * page. Guest rows are never touched on this page; the handoff decision is
 * asked on the game's own pages afterwards.
